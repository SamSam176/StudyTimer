# StudyTimer
This website is a "study timer" developed by me using HTML and CSS for the structure and the graphic component, and JavaScript for the programming logic.

The goal of the site is to provide a useful tool for students to better organize their study sessions, based on the so-called "pomodoro technique": a time management methodology created in the late 1980s, which divides work into time intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) called "pomodori", separated by short breaks, and a longer break at the end of every four intervals. The name comes from the tomato-shaped kitchen timers, very popular at the time.

Through this timer, the student can approach study in a more productive way, alternating periods of concentration with moments of pause, so as to improve efficiency and maintain high attention. Of course, nothing prevents you from using the site for other activities that require structured time management.

Each change of session is signaled by an acoustic signal, similar to what happens with a physical timer.

For greater flexibility, the user has the ability to modify the length of study sessions and breaks, both short and long. In addition, for a more conscious management of time, I have integrated a summary table that shows the statistics related to the study carried out.
